## About 

A script to calculate the total cost of all your rides and the total discount you have received

## Setup

- pip install beautifulsoup4
- sudo apt-get python-lxml

## Usage

- Run the script

```
$ python index.py <your@email.com> <imap.yourmail.com>
```
The imap address for some of the more popular emails include

* yahoo, rocketmail - imap.mail.yahoo.com
* gmail - imap.gmail.com
* hotmail, outlook - imap-mail.outlook.com
* zoho - imap.zoho.com


Enter your email password into the non displaying input on the terminal when prompted


## Updates Required

- Recently, Taxify added a driver waiting time charge to their cost. I haven't added that because I haven't taken a ride since it was been added. If you have, feel free to share a copy of your receipt with me. It would most likely affect the calculation of the discount received but not the total cost of your rides
- Would be nice if this script was adapted to take care of Taxify trips from other countries too, but I can't do that since I don't have a sample receipt to work with
